Global Key Event Handling:

In FTD, we have two different global events

1. $on-global-key[<keys sequence>]$: event_action
   In this case user has to press keys simultaneously with same sequence, and event action will get triggered.

2. $on-global-key-seq[<keys sequence>]$: event_action
   In this case user has to press keys in same sequence, and event action will get triggered.
