Write a code to create a function having argument which accepts a number and returns the square of the number.

Follow below instructions:

1. Create a function by name as `findSquare` having return type as `integer` and with an argument as `number`.

2. Now add the return statement as `number * number` which will return the square of the number. (Note: Always start on new line for return statement having space before previous)

Your code should look like

```
-- integer findSquare(number):
integer number:

number * number

```

2. Now call the `findSquare` function against a `ftd.integer` FTD variable which will have the return value of this function.
   Pass the vaule as 10 during the function call and you will have the output as `100` which is square of 10

Your code should look like:

```
-- ftd.integer: $findSquare(number = 10)

```

You can try changing the values in the arguement to get different squares
