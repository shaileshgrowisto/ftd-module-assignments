Write a code

1. To create a component `displayNameAndAge` accepting name and age as value. You have to display the name and age in the component using FTD variables.
2. Create a record with fields `name` and `age`
3. Create an instance with list for that record with name as people
4. Loop the `people` list and invoke the component `displayNameAndAge` by passing the record fields to the component

Note: When you create list, you have to use `$loop` to use them in sequence.
