Create a FTD file with the name `record-list.ftd`.

In this file, you have to create a record with name student having 2 fields:

1. name with data type as string.
2. age with data type as integer.

Task 1: Create an instance of the `record` as `list` with name `student-list`.

You can assign multiple values of students in the list by passing values to `name` and `age` for each student as item in the record.

Task 2: By using a loop you have to display the values of the student-list records on the web page using `FTD variables`.

`Note: When you create list, you have to use "$loop" to use them in sequence.`
